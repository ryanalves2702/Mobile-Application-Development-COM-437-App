### Project Description

The Android application that will be created is a to-do list app. This app will be a simple application that will be designed to help users to simply organize their daily tasks effectively on any given day. It will allow users to add, edit, and keep track of their tasks as their day goes on. The app will provide the user with a user-friendly user interface in order to avoid any confusion when using the app; after all, it is meant to be simple and easy to use. The goal of the to-do list app is to provide users with enhanced productivity and task management for all users, anywhere from personal use to college students needing to keep track of assignments, and especially to workers in businesses that need to keep track of a ton of tasks in their day.

### Problem to be Addressed

The problem/goal that will be addressed with the to-do list app will be mainly helping those who lack productivity and task management within their daily lives. This will be extremely beneficial to those in the business world who have a ton of different tasks to complete at work. Sometimes it can be tough for people to track every little thing that they need to do during their workday or at school. This app will provide those individuals with the tools necessary in order to stay on top of their daily tasks that they need to complete in their day, while providing a user-friendly user interface. This will ultimately help users map out their tasks for any given day effectively. This app will also provide users with the convenience of a lightweight, and offline experience, meaning they can access their to-do list without the need to connect to an internet connection to view their to-do list.

### Platform

The platform that the to-do list app will be created on is, first of all, the mobile platform, Android. Along with this, the to-do list app will be created using the Java programming language in the Android Studio integrated development environment (IDE).

### Front-End Support

As far as front-end support goes, within the app, the user interface will be designed using XML layouts within the Android Studio integrated development environment (IDE). Along with this, there will be user interface components added, such as Button to add tasks. It will also feature EditText in order to input the users’ tasks into their to-do list. It will also feature RecyclerView/ListView in order for the user to display their tasks so they can actually see them. Finally, it will include CheckBox and a Delete button; these will allow the user to both mark tasks as completed and also delete tasks if they wish to do so.

### Back-End Support

As far as back-end support goes, within the app, there will be multiple tools used, such as cloud databases, in order to actually store tasks inside of a digital warehouse. This will do the job of securing the users’ task information so that it can’t be lost in translation. It will also feature cloud analytics tools, which will enable me on the back end to see how the app is performing. This is extremely important for me in order to see exactly how the app is performing, so that I can make any updates to the app if necessary. I would also like to incorporate a notification system in order to deliver notifications to the users’ mobile device. These notifications will remind them if they need to still complete some tasks in their day that they may have missed. If the user wishes to turn notifications for the app on, they will receive these notifications.

### Functionality

The functionality of the to-do list app is quite simple. The functionalities of the app are listed below:

1.	Add a new task – This is where the user will add any task that they wish to their to-do list. This is important because in order to make their to-do list, the user must be able to add tasks to their to-do list.
2.	View to-do list tasks – This is where the user will be able to view their to-do list and the tasks within their to-do list. This is important because when a user adds tasks to their to-do list, they need to be able to view the tasks so that they can keep track of them throughout their day.
3.	Mark tasks as completed – This is how the user will be able to interact with their to-do list by marking tasks as completed if they wish to do so. This is important for the quality of life of the app because the user will be able to know exactly what tasks they have completed, so they avoid any confusion throughout the day.
4.	Edit Tasks – This is how the user will be able to edit existing tasks on their to-do lists. This is important because if a user had a task that they needed to complete, but they realized they worded it wrong or need it to be completely different, they can save themselves from the confusion and change it to whatever they please.
5.	Delete tasks – This is how the user will be able to delete tasks if they wish to do so. This is important because if the user so longer needs to complete a task, they can remove it, saving them clutter space in their to-do list.

### Design (Wireframes)

The designs and wireframes for the to-do list app are listed below:

Screen 1: Home & Task List – This is where the user will be able to view their tasks, add more tasks, mark tasks completed, or delete tasks. The user will see a heading that states “My Tasks”. It will also include a middle section that will display to the user their tasks, each task will have a checkbox and a delete task icon next to it. This screen will also feature an add task plus sign near the bottom of the screen, where they can click to add new tasks to the to-do list.
Screen 2: Add Task – This is where the user will be able to add new tasks to their list when they press the plus sign from screen 1. The user will see a heading that states “Add New Task”. It will include a middle section that will prompt the user to add a task name. The middle section will also include a “Save Task” button in order for the user to save the task to their to-do list.
Screen 3: Edit Task – This is where the user will be able to edit their existing tasks if need be. The user will see a heading that states “Edit Task”. It will include a middle section that will provide the user with the task name, where they can edit it, and then click “Update Task”. This will allow the user to then save the new edited task to their to-do list.
